# About Clover CRM
Clover CRM is a free CRM tool used to help keep track of client details in the care home industry. 
Its primary goal, for now, is for me to familiarise myself with the Django web framework.  

# Why I've built Clover CRM
After speaking to carers in the care industry, most companies are small, family ran businesses with no official way to keep track of client records (off paper of course).
Most small care companies rely on written down notes when carers hand over their shifts to other carers, this can be unreliable as there's only one copy of the notes.
Furthermore, notes taken on paper can be lost, damaged, or sometimes unreadable.
